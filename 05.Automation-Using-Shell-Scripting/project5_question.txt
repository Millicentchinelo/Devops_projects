Capstone Project: Shell Script for AWS IAM Management
Project Scenario
Datawise Solutions requires efficient management of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) resources. The company is expanding its team and needs to onboard five new employees to access AWS resources securely.
Purpose
In this capstone project, you will extend your shell scripting capabilities by creating more functions that extends the "aws_cloud_manager.sh" script
Objectives:

1.	Script Enhancement:
•	Extend the provided script to include IAM management.
2.	Define IAM User Names Array:
•	Store the names of the five IAM users in an array for easy iteration during user creation.
3.	Create IAM Users:
•	Iterate through the IAM user names array and create IAM users for each employee using AWS CLI commands.
4.	Create IAM Group:
•	Define a function to create an IAM group named "admin" using the AWS CLI.
5.	Attach Administrative Policy to Group:
•	Attach an AWS-managed administrative policy (e.g., "AdministratorAccess") to the "admin" group to grant administrative privileges.
6.	Assign Users to Group:
•	Iterate through the array of IAM user names and assign each user to the "admin" group using AWS CLI commands.
